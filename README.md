This is my final project at Flatiron School built with React frontend and Rails backend utilising CSS for styling and 0Auth for login functionality.

It is an app for flat sharers. You can join as a solo user and keep track of your bills and flat details but you can also create or join a flat with your housemates to keep track of all things flat!

* The home page contains a demo video but also informaiton on how to og in to trail the site.

* Once you have signed up you can use the Dashboard to keep track of your upcoming events and notes about the flat also a quick view of what bills are due.

* Use the communal shopping list to see what needs getting, update with new items or remove itmes you have purchased so the other housemates know what is needed.

* The tasks section is where yo set your household taks as a group then the will be randomally assigned each week to each housemate. Once the task is completed you can click on it and it will be randomally assigned to another housemate for the following week. No more worries abot being stuck cleaning the toilets every week! You can also update the tasks as household needs change.
